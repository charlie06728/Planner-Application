A. The preferred method of communication that your team will use outside of meetings
   (examples: discord, wechat, group emails, etc)
B. How frequently is everyone expected to check and respond to messages? Within 48 hours?
   At least every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday?
C. If you have to meet between Mondays to prepare for your weekly meeting with your TA,
   what are two possible day/times when you could all meet?
D. What format do you want to use for the meeting? Zoom? A Bb Collaborate meeting set up by your instructor?
   Using some other platform?
   (If you request a Bb Collaborate room, one will be created for you on Quercus with "group_0XXX" as its name,
   where XXX will be replaced with your number.)
E. How will you keep track of who is doing which task and what is its status?
   There are a number of apps for this like Trello, Monday, etc or you could track it yourself on a shared Google Doc
   or something similar. Explain how your team has decided to track the status of each task and
   identity of the person in charge of it.
F. If your team wants to have someone check in and make sure that each team member is doing okay and
   ask whether or not they could use more people on a task, who will that person be?
   Will that role be given to different people on different weeks?
   Alternatively, has everyone in the team agreed to report back to the rest of the team if a task turns out to be more
   time-consuming than originally assumed?
G. Is there anything else that your team has agreed on? If not, you can just write "No".
H. So that everyone on your team gets participation marks for this document, please make sure everyone's name is
   included at the bottom of the file.
